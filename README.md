# Mion Testing Procedure 

This repo is to contain information and scripts to run testing tools. 

Currently this is limited to `testing.md`, which documents how to enable the
Yocto Project's Automated Runtime Testing and ptests. In the future, automated
testing scripts and utilities will be added here, to make up a full testing
suite.
